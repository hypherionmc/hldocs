!!!warning
Unfortunately, due to changes in the Minecraft Rendering Engine in 1.17+, it's not possible for me to port the colored light library mentioned below.

For this reason, colored lighting will be totally unavailable in 1.17+ until a replacement lib can be found, or I can magically get it working.

You can still use Hyper Lighting as normal, you just won't have colored lighting.

So sorry about this
!!!

||| About
Hyper Lighting supports addon mods to emit colored light from its light sources. Please find the instructions below to enable it.

||| How to enable colored lighting support

* Make sure you have [RGBLib](https://ci.firstdarkdev.xyz/job/RGBLib/) installed and enabled.
* Colored lighting support should automatically be enabled when you have RGBLib installed. If not, make sure it's enabled by pressing "HOME" (Default keymap. Can be changed) on your keyboard and make sure Use Colored Light is enabled for each item that supports it.
* Press "INSERT" (Default keymap, can be changed) on your keyboard and make sure Colored Lighting is not disabled

!!!info
**RGBLib is the new Hyper Lighting core (it's the same mod, new name, new features). It is not stable for release yet, so if you want to use colored lighting, you will need to download the mod from Jenkins**
