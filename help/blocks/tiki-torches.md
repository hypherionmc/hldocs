||| About
Tiki Torches are another type of light source added to Minecraft by Hyper Lighting. Like the Advanced Torches and Advanced Lanterns, they can also be extinguished and relighted/dyed, and also come in 16 different colors.

They are also lighted and extinguished using the [Torch Lighter Tool](../items/lighter-tool.md) and also support [Colored Lighting](../integrations.md).
