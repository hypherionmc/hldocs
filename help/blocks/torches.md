||| About
Advanced torches are a new set of Lighting sources added by Hyper Lighting. They look and act the same as the original Minecraft Torches, but they can be extinguished and re-ignited and dyed. The torches are available in 16 colors. They can emit colored light by using Addon Mods (See [Colored Lighting](../integrations.md) in Help Center).

Torches can be ignited and extinguished with the [Torch Lighter Tool](../items/lighter-tool.md) (also added by this mod).
