||| About
The Underwater torch and lantern are the demons of the Minecraft world. Not only do they have cool looking flames, these suckers also work underwater. Yes, you read that right. Both of these work underwater!

This torch and lantern are ~~lighted by default (because who has time to light a torch underwater)~~ When configured, but can also be extinguished just like the other torches and lanterns added by this mod by using the [Torch Lighter Tool](../items/lighter-tool.md).
