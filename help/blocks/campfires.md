||| About
Hyper Lighting now includes 2 campfires based on the Minecraft variants. They can be used to provide light and also to cook food. Campfires come in two variants. A normal one which is not water proof and gets put out by rain/water and a Spongebob Campfire. This one is water proof and also works underwater.

Like most light sources in this mod, the campfires are lighted and extinguished by using the [Torch Lighter Tool](../items/lighter-tool.md) and support [Colored Lighting](../integrations.md)
