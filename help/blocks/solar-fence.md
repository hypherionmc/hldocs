||| About
Solar fence lights are battery powered solar lights which can be turned on and off and can also be linked to a switch board. While primarily designed to be used on fences, they can be used almost anywhere, provided they have sun. They charge during the day and discharge at night if they are turned on. They can be turned on and off by right-clicking them.
