||| About [!badge Optifine/Sodium/Iris Compatible]
Colored water... Yes. Because blue water is boring. Unlike other colored water mods, Hyper Lighting colored water is actually useful!

Colored water can be used to grow crops, used in place of dye in some recipes, be used for drinking, sustain fish and other water mobs and colored GLOWING water can be used to grow crops in the dark.

In addition, glowing colored water gives off 3 minutes of night-vision when consumed, and you can also mix Colored Water to create unique design patterns

!!! danger
On older versions of this mod, Optifine Render Regions stops the water from rendering in the world. Make sure you have them disabled, or you won't see the water
!!!

### Crafting
Yes, that sounds weird I know. So firstly, Colored Water generates in almost all biomes in "lakes" (unless disabled in the config). The water can be picked up in buckets, just like normal vanilla water.

But, if you are lazy like me and don't want to go out looking for colored water, you can simply "craft" your own using the recipes below.
