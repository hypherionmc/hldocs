||| About
Hyper Lighting adds new and sometimes useful light sources to Minecraft. It was originally created to just add a single torch to the game that could be turned on and off. It has since involved into a much bigger mod and it now even adds colored lighting to the game with the help of addon mods. The mod also includes a bit of Tech like a Solar Panel, Wireless Electricity and a Switch Board.
